Let's explore each of them:\n","\n","1. **Expressions:**\n","   - An expression is a combination of values (constants or variables) and operators that can be evaluated to produce a result.\n","   - Expressions can involve arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), comparison operations (equals, less than, greater than), logical operations (and, or, not), and more.\n","   - Expressions are used to perform calculations, make decisions, and create new values based on existing data.\n","   - Example: `3 * x + 7` is an expression involving the variable `x` that represents a mathematical calculation.\n","\n","   **Example**\n","\n","   Expression: `(3 * a + b) / 2`\n","\n","    Explanation: In this expression, `a` and `b` are variables. The expression involves multiplication, addition, and division. First, it multiplies the value of `a` by 3, then adds the value of `b`, and finally divides the result by 2. The entire expression evaluates to a new value based on the current values of `a` and `b`.\n","\n","    **Example**\n","\n","   Expression: (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) + 2 * x * y) / (log(z) + c^3)\n","\n","    Explanation: In this expression, x, y, z, and c are variables. The expression involves a combination of mathematical functions. It calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of x and y, adds twice the product of x and y, and then divides the result by the natural logarithm of z plus the cube of the value of c. This expression requires more complex mathematical calculations and may involve the use of predefined mathematical functions.\n","\n","2. **Instructions:**\n","   - An instruction is a single, executable operation that the computer or algorithm carries out.\n","   - Instructions define the step-by-step actions that an algorithm follows to solve a problem or achieve a specific task.\n","   - Instructions can involve assignments, conditionals (if statements), loops, function calls, and more.\n","   - Instructions control the flow of the algorithm by determining what actions are taken based on conditions or input.\n","   - Example: `if (x > 10) { y = x * 2; }` is an instruction that checks if the value of `x` is greater than 10. If true, it assigns the result of `x * 2` to the variable `y`.\n","\n","\n","  **Medium Difficulty Instruction:**\n","\n","  Instruction: Calculate the factorial of a given positive integer `n` and store the result in the variable `factorial`.\n","\n","  Explanation: This instruction involves a loop to calculate the factorial of a given integer `n`. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers from 1 to `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n` and accumulates the product in the `factorial` variable.\n","\n","  ```python\n","  factorial = 1\n","  for i in range(1, n + 1):\n","      factorial *= i\n","  ```\n","\n","  **Hard Difficulty Instruction:**\n","\n","  Instruction: Implement the quicksort algorithm to sort an array `arr` of integers in ascending order.\n","\n","  Explanation: The quicksort algorithm involves dividing an array into two subarrays, sorting each subarray recursively, and then combining them to obtain a sorted array. This instruction requires careful management of indices and swapping elements. Here's a simplified version:\n","\n","  ```python\n","  def quicksort(arr, low, high):\n","      if low < high:\n","          pivot_index = partition(arr, low, high)\n","          quicksort(arr, low, pivot_index)\n","          quicksort(arr, pivot_index + 1, high)\n","\n","  def partition(arr, low, high):\n","      pivot = arr[low]\n","      left = low + 1\n","      right = high\n","      done = False\n","      while not done:\n","          while left <= right and arr[left] <= pivot:\n","              left += 1\n","          while arr[right] >= pivot and right >=left:\n","              right -= 1\n","          if right < left:\n","              done= True\n","          else:\n","              arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]\n","      arr[low], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[low]\n","      return right\n","  ```\n","\n","  This hard instruction requires understanding of the quicksort algorithm, array manipulation, and recursive function calls. It involves more complex control flow and indexing compared to the medium difficulty instruction.\n","\n","  In summary, expressions are used to represent calculations or conditions, and they can be evaluated to produce a value. Instructions, on the other hand, are the building blocks of an algorithm that dictate how the algorithm should proceed and what actions it should take. Combining expressions and instructions allows programmers to create algorithms that manipulate data, make decisions, and perform complex operations.\n","\n","  > expressions are like math problems that involve values and operations, while instructions are like clear steps you give the computer to perform specific actions. Both expressions and instructions are essential for telling the computer what to do and how to do it when writing programs or algorithms.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"11H43WQ-eIpq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","**Mathematical Expressions:**\n","\n","**Explanation:** A mathematical expression is a combination of numbers, variables, and mathematical operations that the computer can evaluate to produce a numerical result.

Mathematical expressions focus on performing numerical calculations, while logical expressions focus on making decisions based on conditions. These concepts are fundamental for programming and problem-solving in various fields.\n","\n","The operators that can be used in logical expressions and mathematical expressions vary depending on the programming language that is being used. However, some common operators include:\n","\n","* **Logical operators** such as `and`, `or`, and `not`\n","* **Arithmetic operators** such as `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`\n","* **Comparison operators** such as `>`, `<`, `==`, and `!=`\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"wJB60j4j9yTj"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Variable declaration and definition (assignment)\n","\n","**Variable Declaration and Definition (Assignment):**\n","\n","**Variable Declaration:** Declaring a variable means letting the computer know that you plan to use a specific name to store data. It's like reserving a storage space for information. When you declare a variable, you give it a name and specify its data type, which determines what kind of data it can hold, like numbers or text.\n","\n","**Variable Definition (Assignment):** After declaring a variable, you can assign a value to it. This is called variable definition or assignment. It's like putting something inside the storage space you reserved. Once a variable is assigned a value, you can use that value in calculations or display it.\n","\n","**Example 1 - Variable Declaration and Definition (Assignment):**\n","```python\n","# Declare a variable named 'age' of type integer\n","int age;\n","\n","# Assign a value of 25 to the 'age' variable\n","age = 25;\n","\n","# Now you can use the 'age' variable in calculations or display\n","```\n","\n","In this example, you declared a variable named 'age' of type integer and then assigned the value 25 to it.

The 'name' variable now contains the name \"Alice,\" which you can manipulate or display in your code.\n","\n","In both examples, variable declaration is about creating a storage space with a specific name and data type.
